# Game-of-Crap
This is a text-based version of game-of-Craps.It is user-defined and takes in the bankroll of the player.
Afterward, their bet information is collected, which include; bet amount, bet type(pass or do not pass).
Player assumes their win or lose in two phase, which are; Point phase and come-out phase.
For every round of the game, the game result is printed. 
At point phase, the player is asked to place an odd bet which is either 3x, 4x or 5x, depending on the result.
Player either win or lose at this point.

For every win, this code assume the player is set to play another round with their bet, hence it will prompt them to roll again. At the other hand, if lost, the program assume they are out since they have zero bet.
